# Custom XLSX Connector

The **Custom XLSX Connector** lets you import products into UnoPim from `.xlsx` spreadsheets and export UnoPim products back out as `.xlsx` files — without requiring a fixed spreadsheet layout. You define **mapping templates** that translate between your spreadsheet's column headers and UnoPim attribute codes, so the connector works with the file your team or vendor already uses.

## How it works

```
Author creates a Mapping Template
        ↓
Choose XLSX column headers and map each one to a UnoPim attribute
Set structural column names, separators, category scope, product-status scope
        ↓
Operator opens Data Transfer → Imports / Exports
        ↓
Pick "XLSX Products" as the importer or exporter type
        ↓
Select the saved Template in the job form
        ↓
Run the job → rows are parsed and mapped (import) or products are written to columns (export)
```

Templates store separate `import_mapping` and `export_mapping` payloads, so the same template can serve both directions or just one.

## Key features

- **Flexible mapping templates** — every XLSX column header is a name you choose; simple and configurable products can map the same column to different attributes.
- **Full product hierarchy** — simple products, configurable products, variant groups, and their parent–child links all survive a round trip in one workbook.
- **All channels and locales in one file** — every channel/locale combination lands on the same product row with no extra setup.
- **Multi-currency pricing** — each currency becomes its own column (e.g. `Price (USD)`, `Price (EUR)`); the currency code in the header is parsed back on import.
- **Category and status scope** — a template can limit both import and export to chosen categories and to enabled-only or disabled-only products.
- **Include media** — an export toggle that copies file, image, and gallery files alongside the workbook.
- **Default values per column** — empty cells are filled with a fallback value set on the template.
- **Formula-injection protection** — all exported values are cleaned so Excel cannot execute formulas when the file is opened.
- **Attribute value separator** — choose the separator used for multiselect option codes (default `,`).
- **Status toggle and mass actions** — enable/disable or delete templates individually or in bulk.
- **Permission-based access** — six individual ACL keys control who can view, create, edit, delete, and mass-update templates.
- **30+ locale translations** — the admin UI ships translated for every locale UnoPim supports.
