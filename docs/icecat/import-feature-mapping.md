# Import: Feature Mapping

The **Icecat Feature Mapping** import job downloads the full list of Icecat specification features for a given credential and locale into the UnoPim database. Once imported, these features appear in the **Select Feature Type** dropdown on the credential's [Attribute Mapping](./attribute-mapping) tab, where you can add them to your enrichment configuration.

**Run this job once before configuring feature attributes on a credential.** Re-run it whenever Icecat releases new specification categories or when you switch to a new credential or locale.

## Prerequisites

- An active Icecat credential. See [Setup Icecat Credentials](./setup-credentials).
