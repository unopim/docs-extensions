## What is the UnoPim Shopify Connector?

The **UnoPim Shopify Connector** is a free, open-source tool that connects your **Shopify store** with **UnoPim** — an open-source Product Information Management (PIM) system.

Without a PIM, managing product data across a store can get messy fast — updating descriptions, images, prices, and variants one by one is time-consuming and error-prone. This connector solves that by letting you manage all your product information in one place (UnoPim) and push it directly to Shopify whenever you're ready.

Whether you're adding new products, updating existing ones, or syncing data across multiple Shopify stores, the connector makes it effortless — with no technical expertise required for day-to-day use.

## What can it do?

- **Export** product data from UnoPim to Shopify — categories, simple products, and products with variants.
- **Import** data from Shopify back into UnoPim — categories, attributes, products, and more.
- Transfer key product details including title, description, images, SEO info, SKU, barcode, price, quantity, and weight.
- Keep your Shopify store up to date by simply re-running an export job whenever something changes.

## Features

### Export Categories as Shopify Collections
UnoPim categories are exported directly as **Collections** in Shopify. This keeps your store structure organized and mirrors how you've categorized products in your PIM.

### Export Products and Variants
Export both simple products and products with multiple variants (e.g., a T-shirt in different sizes and colors). For each variant, you can specify its own **price, SKU, quantity, barcode, and weight**.

### Send Multiple Product Images
You can map multiple image attributes from UnoPim and send them all to Shopify as product gallery images. Both individual image attributes and gallery-type attributes are supported.

### Digital Asset Management (DAM) Support
Use UnoPim **DAM asset attributes** as an image or file source — assets are uploaded to Shopify on export, and Shopify images can be imported back into a DAM asset. Requires the UnoPim **DAM** package to be installed separately.

### Map UnoPim Attributes to Shopify Fields
Not all product fields have the same name in every system. The connector lets you **map your UnoPim attributes to the corresponding Shopify product fields**, so the right data lands in the right place every time.

### Map Product Units
If your products have measurements — like weight, volume, or dimensions — you can map the correct units under **Export Mapping**. This ensures Shopify receives accurate unit data alongside the values.

### Metafield Definitions Support
Shopify supports **metafields** — custom data fields that go beyond standard product information (e.g., material type, warranty info, care instructions). You can create and manage metafield definitions directly in UnoPim and export them to Shopify. Supported types include:

- Single line text
- Multi-line text
- Rich text
- Color
- Rating
- URL
- JSON
- ID
- Choice list
- Weight
- Volume
- Dimension
- Boolean
- Date
- Date & time
- Number
- Image (file)
- File
- Video (file)
- Email
- Link
- Product reference
- Product variant reference
- Collection reference
- Metaobject reference

These are exported without needing any additional mapping setup.

### Shopify Taxonomy Category
Assign each product to a **Shopify standard taxonomy category** using the dedicated `shopify_taxonomy` attribute type with a searchable category picker. The chosen category is exported along with the product and imported back from Shopify.

### Taxonomy-Constrained Metafields
A metafield definition can be **limited to selected Shopify taxonomy categories**, so only products that belong to those categories send that metafield — matching how Shopify scopes category-specific metafields.

### Metaobject Definitions Support
Build Shopify **metaobjects** — reusable structured data such as an Author, Brand, or Material — right inside UnoPim. Create the definition (its fields and validations) and add entries, then reference an entry from your products through a metafield. Definitions and entries are exported to Shopify and can be imported back.

### Multi-Location Inventory
Send stock to **multiple Shopify locations**. Map a quantity attribute to each location and the connector pushes location-wise inventory when the product is **first created** in Shopify. Any location you leave unmapped is skipped. Re-running the export later updates other product details but does not change the inventory quantity in Shopify.

### Multi-Language Support
Export your product data in **multiple languages**. If you manage a multilingual catalog in UnoPim, the connector handles locale-specific content and sends it to the corresponding Shopify translations.

### Multiple Shopify Stores
Connect **more than one Shopify store** to the same UnoPim instance by providing separate credentials for each store. Manage everything centrally without switching between systems.

### Sync Updates Easily
Already exported your products? No problem. Simply re-run the export job at any time to **push updates** from UnoPim to Shopify — no manual edits needed on the Shopify side.

### Import Jobs
The connector is not just for exporting. You can also pull data **from Shopify into UnoPim** using the following import job types:

| Import Type | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Shopify Category** | Imports Shopify collections as UnoPim categories |
| **Shopify Attribute** | Imports Shopify product attributes into UnoPim |
| **Shopify Family Variant Attribute Assignment** | Maps variant attributes to the correct UnoPim product families |
| **Shopify Product** | Imports Shopify products into UnoPim |
| **Shopify Metafield Definitions** | Imports existing Shopify metafield definitions into UnoPim |
| **Shopify Metaobject** | Imports Shopify metaobject definitions and their entries into UnoPim |
